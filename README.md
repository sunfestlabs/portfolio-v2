## chrisnivera.com - v2

This is the second iteration of [chrisnivera.com](https://chrisnivera.com) - my personal portfolio - built using React + Typescript + Next.js + Contentlayer. Credit to [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) and [Robb Owen](https://robbowen.digital/) for a lot of inspiration!

Previous iteration: [v1](https://github.com/sunfestlabs/chrisnivera.com)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install all dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

Finally, start the development server. For some reason this has been hit-or-miss with me on Apple Silicon chips, YMMV.
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load all page fonts.

## Deploy on Vercel
